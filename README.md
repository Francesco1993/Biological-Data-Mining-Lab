# lab-biological-data-mining-obesity
## Implementation of the analysis performed in the paper "Integrative analysis of pathway deregulation in obesity" for the course "Laboratory of Biologial Data Mining" (UNITN 2017-18) 

### Preprocessing
For each dataset we created a new Jupyter Notebook which perform all the pre-processing steps.  
At the end, for each file we have a matrix where the element *Xij* is the value of the gene *i* in the
observation (=sample=person) *j*.
